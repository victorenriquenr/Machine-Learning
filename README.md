Hello, and thanks for stopping by! In this repository I share some machine learning scripts designed to solve some basic competition problems on Kaggle. These scripts reflect my learning experience as a data scientist.

## Notebooks

- **Football_value_of_players.ipynb**:
  This notebook analyzes the value of football players using machine learning techniques. It explores different features and builds models to predict player values based on their performance statistics and other relevant attributes.

- **Titanic_MLP_model.ipynb**:
  This notebook focuses on the classic Titanic survival prediction competition. It employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network to classify passengers as survivors or non-survivors based on various features such as age, gender, class, and fare.

- **spaceshiptitanic.ipynb**:
  In this notebook, the goal is to predict which passengers were transported to an alternate dimension during the journey of the Spaceship Titanic. It utilizes various machine learning algorithms to analyze the given dataset and make accurate predictions.


HAPPY CODE!
